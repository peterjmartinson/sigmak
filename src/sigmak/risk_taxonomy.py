Risk Taxonomy Schema for SEC Filing Classification.

This module defines the proprietary risk categories used to classify
Item 1A: Risk Factors from SEC filings.

Design Principles:
- Mutually Exclusive Categories: Each risk should fit primarily into one category
- Extensible: New categories can be added without breaking existing logic
- Hierarchical: Categories can have subcategories for future refinement
