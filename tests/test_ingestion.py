    Investing in our common stock involves risks. Our business operations face
    significant challenges related to supply chain disruptions, manufacturing
    delays, regulatory compliance, and competitive pressures. The COVID-19

    We rely heavily on international suppliers for critical battery components.
    Any disruption to these supply chains could materially harm our business.
